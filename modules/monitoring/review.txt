- Wondering if we should add a SensorConfig::getSensor() (factory to create a sensor based on getSensorClass()), to a) solve the type hint problem and b), support container service injection like plugins with the create() method. See ContainerFactory, you would just inline that logic. Advantage: Easier to convert to plugins later.
- the status message in CronLastRunAgeSensor is now almost duplicated due to the value type formatting, but that's an existing problem in 7.x.
